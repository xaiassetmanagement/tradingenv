        Parameters
        ----------
        action_space: Union[List[AbstractContract], PortfolioSpace]
            This determines the investment universe of assets that can be
            traded during the simulations, as well any extra logic necessary to
            map an action to a portfolio of assets. To define a continuous
            long-only and unleveraged trading environment, it sufficient to
            pass a list of contracts to be traded. Supported contracts include:
            - tradingenv.contracts.Stock
            - tradingenv.contracts.ETF
            - tradingenv.contracts.Index
            - tradingenv.contracts.Future
            - tradingenv.contracts.FutureChain
            - tradingenv.contracts.AbstractContract for extra customisation.
            If you wish to allow short-selling or leveraged positions, you
            should pass one of the following instances:
            - tradingenv.spaces.DiscretePortfolio for discrete spaces
            - tradingenv.spaces.BoxPortfolio for continuous spaces
            - tradingenv.spaces.PortfolioSpace for extra customisation
            NOTE: there must be market data available for each contract being
            traded. Market data can be passed using the argument `prices` or
            `transmitter`.
        state: Union[IState, list[Feature]]
            This determines the observation space, which is empty by default.
            For backtesting purposes you don't need to specify this argument.
            For reinforcement learning training purposes, you can pass an
            tradingenv.state.IState object or a list of
            tradingenv.features.Feature.
        reward : Union[str, AbstractReward]
            The reward function to be used for reinforcement learning training.
            For backtesting purposes you don't need to specify this argument.
            Supported reward functions include:
            - tradingenv.rewards.RewardPnL
            - tradingenv.rewards.RewardLogReturn
            - tradingenv.rewards.RewardSimpleReturn
            - tradingenv.rewards.RewardDifferentialSharpeRatio
            - tradingenv.rewards.AbstractReward for extra customisation.
        transmitter : Transmitter
            This objects takes care of transmitting data and events at the right
            time during the simulations, as well as setting the timesteps
            at which the portfolio can be rebalanced. Use this argument to pass
            market prices, macroeconomic data or alternative data.
        prices : pd.DataFrame
            If your simulations only require market data, you can specify this
            argument instead of `transmitter`. Market prices can be passed as
            a pandas.DataFrame whose columns are contracts, index are
            timestamps and values are prices. However, this option assumes
            that bid-ask spread is zero. You are therefore recommended to use
            transmitter for more realistic simulations.
        initial_cash : float
            Each simulation starts with this amount of cash, 100 by default.
        broker_fees: IBrokerFees
            The simulation assumes absence of transaction costs by default. To
            set transaction costs including broker commissions, broker markup or
            a rate paid on idle cash you can pass an instance of
            tradingenv.broker.fees.BrokerFees.
        latency : float
            It defines the delay in seconds between the timestep at which the
            portfolio rebalancing decision was made and the time at which the
            trades to rebalance the portfolio are executed. This option can
            be useful when dealing with intraday data. For daily or even slower
            data you should use `steps_delay` instead.
        steps_delay : int
            Unlike `latency` which is expressed in seconds, this is expressed
            in amount of timesteps. For example, if a daily rebalancing
            frequency has been specified in the transmitter, then a rebalancing
            established in time t will be executed in t+1. This is set to
            zero by default to avoid surprised, but it is recommended to set
            this to 1 for more conservative and realistic simulations.
        fit_transformers : bool
            False by default. If True, observations defined by the `state`
            argument are using a class form sklearn.preprocessing.
        episode_length
            If not provided, the episode will terminate when the net liquidation
            value of the assets goes to zero or when market data stops. You
            can optionally provide a number of interaction with the environment
            after which the episode will terminate.
        sampling_span: int
            This argument is used only if episode_length is passed in
            TrandingEnv.reset. If specified, the episode start date is sampled
            using an exponentially decaying probability. sampling_span is the
            number of recent timesteps that captures ~70% of the likelihood of
            sampling a start date from such window. Uniform distribution is
            used by default if this parameter is not provided. It's useful to
            specify a value if you wish to train reinforcement learning agents
            that overweight observations from the more recent past.

        Note: we are loosely borrowing the notation of supervised learning
        where X is the input and Y is the output. While it remains true for X,
        in this application Y is a time series of prices to be traded.

        Parameters
        ----------
        X
            A pandas.DataFrame where index is time and columns are names of the
            exogenous variables. Missing values are allowed. The observation
            space of the environment will have as many variables as the number
            of columns.
        Y
            A pandas.Dataframe where index is time and columns are names of
            the assets being traded. Value are prices. Missing values are
            allowed.
        start
            The backtest of episodes cannot start earlier than this date.
        end
            The backtest of episodes cannot end after this date.
        transformer
            A sklearn.preprocessing transformer used to map the input data in
            a suitable range of deviation. As a shortcut, you can pass 'z-score'
            to standardise the data or 'yeo-johnson' for a power transform that
            will reduce the magnitude of outliers. Default is 'yeo-johnson'.
        transformer_end
            If a transformer is passed and is not fit, then the transformer
            will be fit over all available features data unitl transformer_end.
            If a value is not passed, then the transformer is fitted between
            over all available data until `end`.
        reward
            The reward function. At present, the only supported reawrd function
            is 'logreturn'.
        cash : float
            Each simulation starts with this amount of cash, 100 by default.
        spread
            Bid-ask spread of the assets being traded. It's 0.0002 by default,
            that is 0.02%.
        margin
            This is 0.02 by default, that is 2%. If the notional value of a
            trade over the net liquidation value of the trading account is
            smaller than the margin, then the trade will not be implemented.
            This can be useful to reduce transaction costs by filtering out
            small trades.
        rate
            A pandas series with the risk free rate used to calculate yield on
            idle cash or cost of leverage.
        markup
            Broker markup. If a risk free rate is provided, idle cash in the
            trading account will yield risk_free - markup. Viceversa, if the
            account is leveraged by borrowing from the broker, the cost of
            leverage will by risk_free + markup. This is 0.005 (0.5%) by
            default.
        fee
            The broker will charge a fee proportional to the notional traded
            value. This is 0.0002 (0.02%) by default.
        fixed : float
            Fixed broker fees to be applied to each trade, regardless the
            notional traded value of trade.
        latency : float
            It defines the delay in seconds between the timestep at which the
            portfolio rebalancing decision was made and the time at which the
            trades to rebalance the portfolio are executed. This option can
            be useful when dealing with intraday data. For daily or even slower
            data you should use `steps_delay` instead.
        steps_delay : int
            Number of days that it takes to implement trades. This is 1 by
            default. Note: if zero, then trades are placed in the same instant
            that information act upon becomes available.
        window
            The shape of the observation space will be (window, nr_features).
            Window is 1 by default. The observation will return the last
            `window` observation for each feature. Useful when past observation
            carry useful information.
        stride
            When the window size is greater than 1, the stride parameter is
            used to reduce the dimensionality of the observation. It determines
            the spacing between consecutive rows selected from the most recent
            time.
        clip
            After having transformed the variables, values larger than this
            clip value will be truncated in a [-clip, +clip] range. The default
            clip value is 5.
        reward_clipping
            After scaling the reward to N(0, 1), rewards are clipped within
            the range [-reward_clipping, +reward_clipping]. The default value
            is 2.
        risk_aversion
            Negative rewards are multiplied by (1 + risk_aversion). Zero by
            default. Risk aversion is computed after clipping the reward.
            Empirically, values around 0.1 seem to work well but optimal
            values strongly depend on the use case.
        max_long
            1 (100%) by default. Long a
            llocation in a given asset larger than
            max_long will raise an error.
        max_short
            -1 (-100%) by default. Short allocation in a given asset smaller
            than max_short will raise an error.
        calendar
            Trading calendar code. Prevents the backtest or interaction with
            the environment to occur when markets are closed. 'NYSE' by default.
        folds
            Used to partition the data in multiple folds.
        episode_length
            If not provided, the episode will terminate when the net liquidation
            value of the assets goes to zero or when market data stops. You
            can optionally provide a number of interaction with the environment
            after which the episode will terminate.
        sampling_span: int
            This argument is used only if episode_length is passed in
            TrandingEnv.reset. If specified, the episode start date is sampled
            using an exponentially decaying probability. sampling_span is the
            number of recent timesteps that captures ~70% of the likelihood of
            sampling a start date from such window. Uniform distribution is
            used by default if this parameter is not provided. It's useful to
            specify a value if you wish to train reinforcement learning agents
            that overweight observations from the more recent past.

        Attributes
        ----------
        X : pandas.DataFrame
            Data derived from the input X after having been transformed.
            The environment will use this data to calculate serve observations.
        Y : pandas.DataFrame
            Data derived from the input Y. The environment allows trading
            these asset prices after applying the bid-ask spread.
