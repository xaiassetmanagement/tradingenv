        ----------
        features
            A sequence of classes implementing Feature. For small
            states, you probably don't need this. If your state class is
            becoming too big or if you need features transformation, a common
            requirement in machine learning applications, implementing
            Feature allows logic decoupling as IState will be a
            collection of features. Each feature is an observer of events and
            can define its own logic decoupled from the rest of the state or
            other features.
            Note: if you implement features, you don't have to implement any
            other method of this class. You are expected to implement only
            feature and their abstract methods and attributed. See tests for
            examples.
